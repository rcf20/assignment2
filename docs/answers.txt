8. Inheritance is when a child can use its parent's attributes and functions. 
Polymorphism is the ability of a parent class to have multiple children that can 
override some of the functions of its parent class. Encapsulation is when a class 
or data is wrapped under a single class or namespace.

9. Dictator and Lieutenants workflow: For every pushes from this repository, 
changes are merged to a lieutenant repository that, manages conflicts. The 
lieutenants repository will merge some but not all developers changes.

In the integrations manager, each developer pushes to their own public repository 
and pulls from the blessed/central repository. The integration manager resolves 
conflicts. 

10.The dictator and Lieutenant wokflow has a lieutenant repository that resolves 
conflict and keeps the blessed repository free from problems. This attribute can 
benefit a large team because there will be many changes at once. Whereas a centralized 
workflow has all the developers push to the shared repository, which can cause 
problems when there lots of commits at once.
